  about: "Production Engineering student focused on the software behind automation. I sit right between hardware and software. My engineering background gives me a solid grasp of how machines work, but my main focus is on designing the software systems that run them. I map out the overall logic, figure out how data should flow, and design how things connect. I use AI to handle the actual coding syntax, which lets me focus 100% on building reliable, smart automation systems without getting slowed down by the typing.",
